Hotpaws is a big ol' lunky bruiser. Hotpaws excels at distrupting on the front line or driving the back liners further back away from the fight.

Staying within range of enemies as Hotpaws eventually turns them HOT,
signaled by a fire icon on their hero. Hotpaws can LMB attack them to heal himself and 
deal %HP damage. Sometimes it better to switch targets often for maximum passive procs vs tunneling!

Hotpaws' RMB can hit allies or enemies so you can use it not only to knock enemies into you (or the tower!),
but also help allies escape sticky situations.
