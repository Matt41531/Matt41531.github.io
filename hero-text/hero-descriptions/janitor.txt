Jan Itor is a tanky disruptor that thrives on controlling the battlefield.

Jan Itor's tankiness relies on proper ability usage. His empowered auto attack grants a shield
based on the number of enemies hit and his D&D barrier will protect you from projectiles (including the tower!).
Use both of these to stay alive!

Jan Itor's Movement Ability, Clean Sweap, stuns enemies that are pushed into a wall. Always be on the lookout
for unique angles!

Whenever you hit more than 2 people with your ultimate, you have to yell HUUUUUUUGE TOILET.
