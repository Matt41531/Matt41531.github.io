Kana is a high-mobility damage dealer that relies on proper teamfight positioning on the outskirts to dish out
maximum damage. She has a 3-hit passive that gernates a meal upon proccing, which heals Kana, grants her
bonus attack power, and most importantly, makes her sword grow!

Kana's ultimate can be recasted after the initial cast to make the truck drive away, 
giving you a second chance to make sure your enemies aren't jaywalking.

Kana's Q ability is a counter, but be warned, only some abilities are counterable. AoE ground and location
spells like stuns cannot be countered, so be sure to time your counter window properly!

If you're struggling to survive in chaotic fights, purchasing a defensive item isn't the worst idea.
But... yes, just stacking more damage is fun too!
