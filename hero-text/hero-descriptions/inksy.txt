Inksy is a bursty mage that requires combos to ensure her abilities land.

You can hold Inksy's RMB and drag your mouse to draw the projectile path. Upon release, the projectile 
will follow that path. Get creative with the shapes you draw to deal maximum damage!

Inksy's Q meteor may seem difficult to hit at first, but with practice, her SPC and Ultimates can be used to help land it.
A common combo is placing Q, then using SPC to knock enemies into it!
