Snooker is a long ranged damage dealer that relies on precise aim and positioning to maximize DPS.

Snooker's auto-attack can be charged up for extra damage and a knockback. 
In addition, this LMB can be bounced off of walls and obstacles!

Be sure to use his various knockbacks from LMB, RMB, and SPC to your advantage by knocking enemies into your
Pocket (Q).

Snooker is very vulnerable if he gets collapsed on. Work with your teammates to ensure you're the one putting
out pressure vs getting pressured.

Snooker's ultimate can be controlled with WASD and detonated early by pressing R again. Dmaage is also
buffed by 800% if you say "HERE COMES THE SNOOKER SPECIAL" while casting it.
