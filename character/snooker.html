                        <p> Snooker is a perfect-shot-making Machina who adores the imperfect existence of humanity… so much so that he believes he is, in fact, a real human being. It’s quite obvious Snooker is not human, but nobody in Sparkadia reminds him of this fact because, well, attempting to be human brings him so much joy, and he puts quite a lot of effort into creating his own identity. Despite his quirks, Snooker has never, ever missed a shot—which, aside from his appearance, is the only nagging evidence that he was born a Machina. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Hailing from an alternate universe where machines evolved to be the solitary form of sentient life, Snooker is a Freecoded being, programmed into existence from a vast sea of endless data and allowed to develop on his own. In his reality, Snooker took part in numerous games of skill and precision, becoming somewhat of a celebrity athlete. His calculation speed verged on ultra-instantaneous. His trans-dimensional trigonometric trick shots were feats to behold, like the time he knocked an entirely lifeless (and rather depressed) galaxy into a supermassive black hole using nothing but a simple FENTI* rocket, a protractor, and a single matchstick. The resulting gravitational anomalies caused lots of data-confusion in the Machina network, and resulted in the only known instance of a super-swole singularity. Naturally, this put Snooker on the map and catapulted him to equal parts fame and notoriety. A mysterious sect of Machina leadership known as the Parsectors took great interest in Snooker and followed him around, even ordering several agents to apprehend him. In Machina culture, the Parsectors are both terrifying and glorified—and they never fail. Snooker, however, was oblivious to their interest in him, and with unwitting precision always evaded capture. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now, Snooker works as a waiter at Steve’s Sprockethouse in downtown Sparkadia. It’s the hottest restaurant on Avonova, with an eons-long waiting list. But maybe, just maybe, Snooker will sneak you in for a meal, or at least entertain you by building a perfectly balanced Eiffel Tower of champagne glasses, but only for his human friends.
