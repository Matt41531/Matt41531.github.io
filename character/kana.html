                        <p> As a child, Kana read through the only book that captured her attention: Attaining Flavor Fusion, by Chef David Kensu. She was enraptured by the photos of the recipes, the lists of ingredients that read like another language. In the 200 years since David Kensu wrote his book, nearly all the ingredients he’d used had gone extinct. Many nights, Kana lay awake wondering what a kiwi was, and how it tasted—or if farm-raised salmon did taste different from wild-caught. So many flavors, lost to time… 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Kana didn’t despair. According to Chef Kensu: a true chef must be able to cook with what is available to her. So, she joined Slingmeat, a fast-food crew renowned throughout Nueva Seoul as the best cheap sandwiches of reconstituted whatever. She developed her skills and saved enough to buy her own food truck, which she commissioned “Sashimichanga.” Life on the road was a dream. She drove around the city, exploring its nooks and neighborhoods, delivering hot Slingmeat sandwiches all over. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Everyone who visits her food truck raves about Kana’s bold new flavor experiments, and they also know to never touch her knife, or criticize her cooking… with one notable exception. Kana can’t seem to prepare sustenance that Machina can consume and enjoy. She’s still learning. After all, she’s only just tasted strawberries for the first time. Kana set herself to the task of becoming the first interdimensional, pan-galactic master chef.
